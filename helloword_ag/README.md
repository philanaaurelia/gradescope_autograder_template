This is the basic form of the Gradescope Autograder: Diff-based solution with no additional files. 
The following problem is here:

```
(3) (20 points) Hello World

Write a program titled a C++ program in a file titled hello_world.cpp
that prompts a user for their full name and displays “Hello, [name here]!”
The output format should look EXACTLY (except for the name of
course!) like the following example:

What is your name? Philana Benton
Hello, Philana Benton!
```

# Modified files/folders 
## BUILD-FILES
Contains the Makefile used to compile student submitted C++ file(s). 
- I emphasized importance of naming the file `hello_world.cpp`, otherwise the build will fail! Also note that the executable is named `main`. This is because its easier to edit different autograders for different problems.

## EXECUTION-FILES
Contains all files needed to run the student code and solution code needed to perform a diff.
- I added the test files I wanted to run as input for the student code and my solution code.

## REFERENCE-FILES
Contains all references files related to the solution
- I added the correct solution I wrote here (`hello_world.cpp`). Make sure this file is the same name as the student submitted file.

## diff.sh
Contains the bash code needed to run the executable (with any necessary execution files), as well as points awarded for the test case and the name of the test case
- Notice the example of bash code below from **diff.sh**. Remember, that I named the executable `main` in the Makefile. I want to read in my test file(s) located in the EXECUTION-FILES folder, make each test case 10 points, and have the test case name show up as "Test case 1" to the student.
```bash
#@test{"stdout":10, "name":"Test case 1"}
./main < test1.txt
```

## grade.sh
Contains the instructions for what the grader should grade, how to build code in order to run it, and what type of grading should occur. It also spits out a nice little error if the student did not properly name the file.
- In my case, I wanted the grader to grade the file `hello_world.cpp` submitted by the student, run the Makefile I generated, and use diff-based grading, so I updated the following 3 lines to meet my needs:
```bash
EXPECTED_FILES="hello_world.cpp"
MAKE_TARGET="all"
DIFF_TOOLS=gs-diff-based-testing
```

## run_autograder
The bash executable that begins the autograder by compiling, running, and grading the code. First it must copy over the student submission file. 
- In my case, I wanted the autograder to copy over the file I told the student to submit, so I made sure the file was named `hello_world.cpp` by updating the following line in the file:
```bash
# Set up autograder files
cp /autograder/submission/hello_world.cpp .
```

# Un-modified files/folders 
* setup.sh
* LICENSE
* MAKE-REFERENCE.sh (Note: this would have been modified if I didn't want to do diff based grading)
* apt-get.sh (Note: this would have been modified if I wanted to change C++ compliler flavors/versions)

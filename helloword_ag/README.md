This is the basic form of the Gradescope Autograder: Diff-based solution with no additional files. 
The following problem is here:

```
(3) (20 points) Hello World

Write a program titled a C++ program in a file titled hello_world.cpp
that prompts a user for their full name and displays “Hello, [name here]!”
The output format should look EXACTLY (except for the name of
course!) like the following example:

What is your name? Philana Benton
Hello, Philana Benton!
```

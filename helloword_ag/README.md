This is the basic form of the Gradescope Autograder: Diff-based solution with no additional files. 
The following problem is here:

```
(3) (20 points) Hello World

Write a program titled a C++ program in a file titled hello_world.cpp
that prompts a user for their full name and displays “Hello, [name here]!”
The output format should look EXACTLY (except for the name of
course!) like the following example:

What is your name? Philana Benton
Hello, Philana Benton!
```

# Modified files/folders 
## BUILD-FILES
Added my Makefile to make the student submitted code. I emphasized importance of naming the file `hello_world.cpp`, otherwise the build will fail

## REFERENCE-FILES
Added the correct solution `hello_world.cpp` file that I wrote here.
